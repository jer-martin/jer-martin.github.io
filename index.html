            <p>Today's work was adding some nice looking details. I changed the fonts to something a little less basic, and then I added outlines and
              box shadows to the cards.

            <p>A photo of my friends and I on our camping trip, along with FIS job offer!</p>
            <p>Making my first proper blog post on here. I wanted to go over the last few months, as I have made large strides in my career. I applied to 
              many internships (like 20 or so?) and I got interviews with 3 companies. Out of the 3 interviews I got, I recieved 2 offers! This is amazing 
              news, honestly, as I was insanely worried about how I was going to do. I ended up accepting an offer from FIS Global, a fintech company based out 
              of Jacksonville. Conveniently, the job is in Brown Deer, Wisconsin, which is very close to my family up in WI. Winter break was very cool. I couldn't 
              go on the pure climbing trip to Rocktown like I wanted because of my shoulder, so I went camping with my friends from Jacksonville to a beautiful 
              place called Cloudland Canyon, in Georgia. It was awe-inspiring to see such a massive gorge in the next state over from Florida. Anyways, I'm excited
              for things to come!
