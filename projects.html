            <p>A snake game I built with simple Javascript. It looks bad and plays worse, but I was bored. This doesn't work on mobile.</p>

            <p>Image of Cache Simulation graph. I wrote this in Python, and it was very empowering to see how strong Python is right out of the box.</p>
            <p>For this project, we had to write 3 different types of cache simulators, that simulated direct mapped, set associative (n-way), and fully associative caches. We had to implement a way to adjust cache size and set associativity, as well as map the performance of the three different caches onto a graph representing speed vs size. For this project, I used nvim and the command line. I used this time to start to get used to vim keybinds.</p>

            <p>Image of functional Nhovas code.</p>
            <p>Nhovas is the name of the language that I programmed in my Introduction to Programming Languages class. We had to write a Lexer, Parser, Analyzer, Interpreter, and Generator, all inside of Java. This was an intense, semester long project that taught me a lot. For this project, I used IntelliJ Idea, and data structures provided by my professor.</p>

            <h3>Terpscraper</h3>
            <h5>Completed on Oct 7th, 2022</h5>
            <img class="fakeimg" src="terpscraper_shot.png" alt="A screenshot of Terpscraper output">
            <p>Image of Terpscraper output.</p>
            <p>This was a side project that was not school-related. I have a medical cannabis card, and the dispensaries make it difficult to actually know what you're getting when you buy it, so I decided to build my Python skills by creating a solution for that. I used Trulieve's website, as it doesn't have an API. I used BeautifulSoup 4 to webscrape the site, get all of the product urls, then scrape the product sites for a link to a pdf with the test results. I then used PyPDF2 to parse through these PDF files and extract THC and terpene percentages. I then collected all of these results and put them into a cleaned up text file. It has been used by myself and a few other people in the state with medical cards.</p>
